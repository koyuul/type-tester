    <h1>update 12/25/2020 </h1>
    <hr class = "line-break">
    <p>Merry Christmas bois. Sorry it took so long to update, I've just been looking at other programming stuffs.
    I want to keep up with this extension more, as this actually has some users. Anyways, here are the changes:
    </p>
    
    <h4> New Features: </h4>
    <dl>
        <dt>Sync Stuff</dt>
            <dd>You guys probably won't notcie that I've found out how to make use of the sync feature, which 
                basically lets you save your data to your account after you close the extension. While there's
                no direct effect, I'll be able to push out updates a lot faster pog
            </dd>
        <dt>Skip Shortcut:</dt>
            <dd>Press control+enter in order to skip the current prompt! Customizable shortcut coming soon.</dd>
        <dt>Customizable Themes</dt>
            <dd>As you could probably tell, you can change the theme of the extension now. I included
                a couple of presets at the bottom. Make sure you click save. I'd really love to have more 
                presets, so if you message me on twitter or instagram, then I'll be glad to add them to 
                the next update with your name on it!
            </dd>
    </dl>

        instagram,</a> or <a href = "https://twitter.com/home"> twitter</a> :)
    Stay safe everyone!
    </p>
    <h1>update 10/6/2020 </h1>
    <hr class = "line-break">

    <p>Hey everyone! You might've noticed there's a new update! For the past few days, I know that the prompts haven't 
    been loading. I believe that the API that I was using is no longer supported, so I switched the quote API to 
    <a href = "https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/free-api-inspirational-quotes-json-with-code-examples/311373"> 
    Type.fit</a>! Thanks for using my extension, it makes me happy that people are using it :) I will be adding
    Record WPM, and maybe some form of settings next update. Thanks again!</p>

    <h4> New Features: </h4>
    <dl>
        <dt>Session WPM (swpm)</dt>
            <dd>The WPM of the current session of the extension. (From when you open the extension, 
                to when you close it</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Again, if you have any complaints, requests, or ideas, please let me know at @koyuul on <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/koyuul/">
        instagram,</a> or <a href = "https://twitter.com/home"> twitter</a> :)
    Stay safe everyone!
    </p>
