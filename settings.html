    <p>Hey everyone! You might've noticed there's a new update! For the past few days, I know that the prompts haven't 
    been loading. I believe that the API that I was using is no longer supported, so I switched the quote API to 
    <a href = "https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/free-api-inspirational-quotes-json-with-code-examples/311373"> 
    Type.fit</a>! Thanks for using my extension, it makes me happy that people are using it :) I will be adding
    Record WPM, and maybe some form of settings next update. Thanks again!</p>

    <h4> New Features: </h4>
    <dl>
        <dt>Session WPM (swpm)</dt>
            <dd>The WPM of the current session of the extension. (From when you open the extension, 
                to when you close it</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Again, if you have any complaints, requests, or ideas, please let me know at @koyuul on <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/koyuul/">
